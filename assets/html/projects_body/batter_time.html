<!-- Inventory -->
<h3 class="contribution-title">Inventory System</h3>

<p>
    One of the most complex and central systems of the game is its inventory system.
    The inventory is used, primarily to hold either ingredients or cooked products.
    This system was of great importance as many different types of game entities need the ability to hold items. Most notably:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="highlighted-text">The Player:</span> Needs to hold any type of item and display them in their hotbar as UI elements.</li>
    <li><span class="highlighted-text">Storage Stations:</span> The fridge and the shop counter need to hold and display the items as 3D entities in the world, ingredients for the former, cooked products for the latter.</li>
    <li><span class="highlighted-text">Cooking Stations:</span> Every cooking appliance the player can use needs at least 3 item slots (2 for the ingredients and 1 for the final product) to display items same as the storage stations.</li>
    <li><span class="highlighted-text">Shops:</span> The shops need to display items in the world, same as storage units as well as display their prices as UI elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    To accommodate these requirements, I designed a slot-based inventory system, attempting to follow a MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach: This system was planned as shown below:

<h4>ItemDB</h4>

<p>
    Information about every possible item is stored in a json file which is loaded into a singleton (ItemDB) to be accessed by other classes.
    Items are identified by their ID, which is used to retrieve other data when necessary (graphics, 3D model, cooking time, price, ...).
    Additionally, for items that need modifiers (such as cooking quality for cooked products), this information is stored as a suffix to the string ID.
</p>

<h4>Inventory and ItemStack</h4>

<p>
    Each game object that needs to hold items contains an Inventory instance, which holds a collection of ItemStack instances.
    The ItemStack has identifies an item ID and a quantity.
    These classes form the Model classes of this system.
</p>

<h4>WorldInventory and Hotbar</h4>

<p>
    Finally, depending on the purpose, each game object has an appropriate Controller class to either display item models (via and ItemEntity game object) or their icons in UI (via the HotbarSlot).
    Each of the View classes then listens for changes in their linked ItemStack to update accordingly.
    <br><br>
    This system also allowed a simple way to change the location of the displayed items in shops and stations.
    This is because the ItemEntity is a normal GameObject, meaning that it can positioned via its transform in the editor like any other.
    When loaded, the corresponding WorldInventory populates its owned ItemEntities with the appropriate 3D asset.

<!-- Time -->
<h3 class="contribution-title">Time Management</h3>

<p>
    As we were planning the game, it became clear that this would be a heavily time-based game, with multiple factors and interactions depending on time, as shown in our planning flowchart below:
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-around image-holder">
    <div class="col-lg-2">
        <img src="/assets/img/projects/batter_time/time_events.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Perspective shader diagram">
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    All of these events would need to be synchronised and work in unison.
    To this effect, I also designed a time system and event management that ensured all relevant entities were notified of significant time changes.
    For this, I created a central TimeManager entity responsible for managing the time of day and sending global events at each significant time.
    This was accomplished by exposing a set of UnityEvent objects which different entities should connect and listen to.
    The interaction between the TimeManager and remaining entities was planned and implemented as shown below:

<!-- 3D Models -->
<h3 class="contribution-title">Character Modelling</h3>

<p>
    I was also responsible for creating the concept art for some of the characters, but modelling all of them. They can be separated into four main characters, including the player:
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-around image-holder">
    <div class="col-lg-5">
        <img src="/assets/img/projects/batter_time/characters.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Perspective shader diagram">
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Additionally, I also created a series of filler NPC characters that could be created on the fly.
    For this, I created two basic body types (one male and one female).
    Then, I created three clothing variations and, separately, four hairstyles for each gender.
    Another member of the group, then, created a system to randomly generate an NPC filler, selecting a gender, clothing type and hairstyle randomly and, then, colouring them accordingly.
