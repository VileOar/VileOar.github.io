<h3 class="contribution-title">Procedural Generation</h3>

<p>
    The game world is procedurally generated to always create a different experience.
    I was responsible for designing and implementing the generation pipeline, which needed to integrate well with the spawn locations of settlements, factories and other map event tiles, as well as work well with the quest system, namely quests that required the player to visit a random tile on the map.
    The resulting pipeline consisted of the following steps.

<h3 class="contribution-title">Perspective Effect</h3>

<p>
    While planning the game, the team concluded that a top down perspective would be ideal, as a tile-based game. However, we wanted our game to have a more unique feel. Furthermore, knowing that we wanted weather catastrophes to play a big event, we struggled on how to best display them on-screen.
    To tackle these issues, I came up with the idea of implementing an oblique perspective, inspired by the SNES mode 7. This would allow a top-down-like perspective, while also keeping the sky visible for the weather and provided a better look for the game.
    <br><br>
    To achieve this, the game grid is implemented as a normal 2d orthogonal grid of cells (later rendered as hexagonal cells). To transform this into the desired perspective, a screen shader effect is applied that warps the canvas into a trapezoid (as shown in the image below).

<!-- TODO: two images demonstrating a rectangle into a trapezoid -->

<p>
    The resulting empty section at the top is, then, filled with a sky background (which changes according to weather).
    Finally, other entities (mountains, players, settlements, factories, ...) are drawn on top of this effect. While their graphics are not warped (to preserve their shapes), they are drawn at positions appropriate to the warped grid.
