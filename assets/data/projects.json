Nevertheless, we had to go on, so we made a smaller prototype as a proof of concept. In the end, while we could not use the project for its intended purpose, we managed to successfully implement every functionality we had planned.<br><br>While we all equally contributed to the project and occasionally stepped into each other's work, we each had our primary role.
